# VMware NSX Security — Setup Guide

## Prerequisites

- NSX Manager 3.x or 4.x (NSX-T)
- An NSX admin account with DFW read/write permissions
- Python 3.10+ and `uv` installed

## 1. Install

```bash
uv tool install vmware-nsx-security
```

Verify:
```bash
vmware-nsx-security --help
```

## 2. Create Config Directory

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.vmware-nsx-security
```

## 3. Create Config File

Copy the example and edit:

```bash
# From the package source directory
cp config.example.yaml ~/.vmware-nsx-security/config.yaml
```

Or create manually:

```yaml
# ~/.vmware-nsx-security/config.yaml
targets:
  nsx-prod:
    host: nsx-manager.example.com
    username: admin
    port: 443
    verify_ssl: true
    environment: production   # Which environment this is — see below
  nsx-lab:
    host: 10.0.0.50
    username: admin
    port: 443
    verify_ssl: false   # Allow self-signed cert in lab
    environment: lab

default_target: nsx-prod
```

**`environment` (declare it now)**: policy rules scope by environment, and this declaration is the only thing that tells them which of your NSX Managers is production — the target's *name* is not used for it. Any label you like works (`production`, `staging`, `lab`, `dc2-prod`); `production` is the one the shipped rules attach a second-person approval requirement to for irreversible work.

A target that declares nothing counts as unknown. Today a state-changing operation against it still runs and logs a warning; the next major release refuses it. Declaring `environment:` on each target now makes that upgrade a no-op. Read-only operations are never affected either way. Run `vmware-audit policy` to see the rules currently in force.

## 4. Set Passwords

Passwords are **never** stored in `config.yaml`. Use environment variables or a `.env` file:

```bash
# Create .env file
cat > ~/.vmware-nsx-security/.env << 'EOF'
VMWARE_NSX_SECURITY_NSX_PROD_PASSWORD=your_prod_password
VMWARE_NSX_SECURITY_NSX_LAB_PASSWORD=your_lab_password
EOF

# Secure the file — IMPORTANT
chmod 600 ~/.vmware-nsx-security/.env
```

**Password variable naming convention**: `VMWARE_NSX_SECURITY_<TARGET>_PASSWORD`
where `<TARGET>` is the target name uppercased with hyphens → underscores.

## 5. Verify Setup

```bash
vmware-nsx-security doctor
```

All checks should show PASS:
- Config file
- .env permissions (owner-only 600)
- Config parse (N targets configured)
- Password (set for each target)
- Network (TCP reachable on port 443)
- NSX auth (session created)
- NSX version (vX.Y.Z)
- MCP server import

## 6. Configure MCP Server

### Claude Code

Add to `~/.claude.json` (or `.claude.json` in your project):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "vmware-nsx-security": {
      "command": "vmware-nsx-security",
      "args": ["mcp"],
      "env": {
        "VMWARE_NSX_SECURITY_CONFIG": "~/.vmware-nsx-security/config.yaml"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Cursor

In Cursor Settings → MCP Servers:

```json
{
  "vmware-nsx-security": {
    "command": "vmware-nsx-security",
    "args": ["mcp"],
    "env": {
      "VMWARE_NSX_SECURITY_CONFIG": "${HOME}/.vmware-nsx-security/config.yaml"
    }
  }
}
```

### Goose

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "vmware-nsx-security": {
      "command": "vmware-nsx-security",
      "args": ["mcp"],
      "env": {
        "VMWARE_NSX_SECURITY_CONFIG": "~/.vmware-nsx-security/config.yaml"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> v1.5.15+ recommends the single-command form `vmware-nsx-security mcp`. Pre-1.5.15 used
> `uvx --from vmware-nsx-security vmware-nsx-security-mcp`, which still works but re-resolves
> from PyPI on each launch and breaks behind corporate TLS proxies. The legacy
> `vmware-nsx-security-mcp` entry point is also kept for backward compatibility.

## 7. Docker (Optional)

Build and run as a container:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

Mount your config:
```yaml
# docker-compose.yml already mounts ~/.vmware-nsx-security:/root/.vmware-nsx-security:ro
```

## Companion Skill Setup

For full NSX coverage, also install:

```bash
# NSX networking: segments, gateways, NAT, routing
uv tool install vmware-nsx-mgmt

# vSphere monitoring
uv tool install vmware-monitor
```

Configure each with its own config directory:
- NSX networking: `~/.vmware-nsx/config.yaml`
- NSX security: `~/.vmware-nsx-security/config.yaml`
- Monitor: `~/.vmware-monitor/config.yaml`

Both `vmware-nsx` and `vmware-nsx-security` can point to the same NSX Manager hosts — the config files are separate because the password env vars differ.

### Password obfuscation at rest

On first load, any plaintext `*_PASSWORD` value in `.env` is automatically
rewritten to a grep-safe `b64:<encoded>` form and decoded transparently at
runtime, so a casual `grep` of the file no longer reveals the password. Values
are read and written through python-dotenv's own parser, so the stored secret
never drifts from what you configured (quotes, inline comments, and trailing
whitespace are handled correctly).

> **This is obfuscation, not encryption.** Anyone who can read the file can
> still decode it. For real secrecy at rest, do not store the password in `.env`
> at all — inject it from a secret manager (HashiCorp Vault, CyberArk, AWS
> Secrets Manager, or a Kubernetes Secret) into the `*_PASSWORD` environment
> variable at process start. The code reads the env var either way.

## Read-Only Mode

Off by default. When on, all 11 write tools are removed from the MCP registry at start-up,
so `list_tools()` never offers them — the model cannot call what it cannot see, and no
prompt discipline is required. The 10 read tools are unaffected. `run_traceflow` is
withheld along with the rule and group mutations: injecting a probe packet into the data
plane is a write, even though it changes no configuration.

Three ways to turn it on, highest precedence first:

| Setting | Scope |
|---------|-------|
| `VMWARE_NSX_SECURITY_READ_ONLY=true` | this skill only |
| `VMWARE_READ_ONLY=true` | every installed VMware skill — one variable puts the whole estate into an audit posture |
| `read_only: true` in `~/.vmware-nsx-security/config.yaml` | this skill, persisted to disk |

Precedence is **per-skill env → family env → config → off**. The environment variables come
first so a deployment can be locked down from the MCP client's `env` block without editing
any config file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "vmware-nsx-security": {
      "command": "vmware-nsx-security",
      "args": ["mcp"],
      "env": { "VMWARE_READ_ONLY": "true" }
    }
  }
}
```

An empty string (`"VMWARE_READ_ONLY": ""`) counts as unset, not as an explicit off — a
template leftover is not a decision, and treating it as one would let it override
`read_only: true` in config.

**Fail-closed.** If read-only mode is requested but cannot be *proven* — the tool registry
cannot be enumerated, or a removal does not take effect — the server refuses to start rather
than serve write tools it promised to withhold. A misspelled value is handled differently:
`VMWARE_READ_ONLY=ture` does not abort, it resolves to **on** with a warning, so a typo
locks the deployment down instead of quietly leaving it open.

**Verifying it took.** `vmware-nsx-security doctor` reports the resolved state and which
setting it came from — including the case where an unrecognised value enabled the mode by
accident. The MCP server's start-up log additionally names every tool that was withheld.

- **Source Code**: Fully open source at [github.com/zw008/VMware-NSX-Security](https://github.com/zw008/VMware-NSX-Security) (MIT). The `uv` installer fetches the `vmware-nsx-security` package from PyPI, which is built from this GitHub repository. We recommend reviewing the source code and commit history before deploying in production.
- `config.yaml` should be readable only by your user: `chmod 600 ~/.vmware-nsx-security/config.yaml`
- `.env` must be `chmod 600` — the doctor check warns if it is too permissive
- Use a dedicated read/write NSX account for security operations, not the global `admin` superuser
- Audit logs are written to `~/.vmware/audit.db` (SQLite WAL mode, via vmware-policy)
- The MCP server uses stdio transport — it never opens a network port; it is started on-demand by your AI agent
