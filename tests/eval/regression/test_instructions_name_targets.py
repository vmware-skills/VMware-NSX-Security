"""The server's `instructions` is the only place a client learns which managers exist.

Background, 2026-09-15. Every tool in this skill takes ``target``, and a client
that is never told what the configured targets are calls them without one, gets
the default, and answers about whatever system happens to be first. That is not
hypothetical: in Monitor the default was a standalone ESXi host, so "how many VMs
does the vCenter have" was answered from that host, confidently and wrongly.
NSX-Security shipped a static ``instructions`` string that named no target at all.

What this pins:

* the configured target **names and hosts** reach the built instructions, and the
  default is marked as the default — so the model can pick one on purpose;
* both marker phrases are present, because those are what a client and the
  family gate look for;
* all three branches keep the ``Configured targets:`` sentence — the listing,
  "none yet" when the file is readable but empty, and "could not be read
  (<Type>)" when it is not. A missing config is the normal state before ``init``
  and must not stop the server from starting; a client shown no listing at all
  cannot tell "no targets" from "could not read them";
* the unreadable branch interpolates only the exception's **type** — its text
  quotes the config path, and this string goes straight into client context.

The config loader is monkeypatched rather than written to disk: this must hold on
a machine with no ``~/.vmware-nsx-security/config.yaml``, which is exactly where
the fallback path is reachable.
